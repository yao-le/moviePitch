MoviePitch is an AI-driven app that turns a single-line idea into an elaborate movie concept, featuring a detailed synopsis, title, cast, and cover art, using the OpenAI API. This app harnesses the power of `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for generating text and `dall-e` for image creation. It adopts Zero-Shot and Few-Shot prompting techniques to improve the variety and richness of the content it creates.
